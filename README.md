 **A next-generation sport that blends exploration, technology, and speed.**

##  What is Digital Twin Time Trials?
**DTTT** is a competitive sport where teams of 3 to 5 people, along with AI, race to **create digital twins of real-world locations in record time**. Using drones, LiDAR sensors, 3D cameras, and VR, they map environments as accurately and quickly as possible.

 **Competition Categories**
- **Natural:** Forests, waterfalls, mountains.
- **Urban:** Cities, skyscrapers, tunnels.
- **Historical-Archaeological:** Ruins, temples, fortresses.
- **Underwater:** Coral reefs, shipwrecks, underwater caves.
- **Olympic (Premium):** No drones, only athletes manually capturing data.

 **Main Rules**
1.  **Objective:** Create a complete, VR-ready digital twin as fast and accurately as possible.
2.  **Time:** The race starts with the first data capture and ends upon model submission.
3.  **Scoring:** Teams are judged on **speed (50%)**, **accuracy (30%)**, and **completeness (20%)**.
4.  **Ethics:** No environmental damage, privacy violations, or drone law breaches allowed.

 **First pilot tournament coming soon. Follow us for updates!**
